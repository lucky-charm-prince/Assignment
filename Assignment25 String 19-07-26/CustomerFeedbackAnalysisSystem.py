# Customer Feedback Analysis System 

# An e-commerce company receives thousands of customer reviews every day for its products.

# To analyze customer opinions efficiently, the analytics team wants a Python program that counts how many times each word appears in a review message.

# This helps the company identify frequently used words such as:

# good
# bad
# delivery
# quality
# service

# Write a Python program to count the frequency of every word in a given sentence.

# Input:
# delivery was fast and delivery service was good
# Output:
# delivery : 2
# was : 2
# fast : 1
# and : 1
# service : 1
# good : 1


s=input("Enter the String : ")
word=s.split()
s1=""
for i in word:
    if i not in s1:
        s1+=i+" "

word1=s1.split()
for i in word1:
    count=0
    for j in word:
        if i==j:
            count+=1
    print(i,count)

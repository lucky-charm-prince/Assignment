# Adam Number Verification System – Question

# A high-security digital system is designed to validate special mirrored numbers known as Adam Numbers before granting access to sensitive data.

# When a user enters a numeric code, the system performs a dual verification process:

# * It calculates the square of the entered number.
# * It reverses the number and calculates the square of the reversed value.
# * Finally, it checks whether both results are mirror images (reverses) of each other.

# A number is called an Adam Number if:
# The square of the number and the square of its reverse are reverses of each other.

# Task:
# Write a Python program to check whether a given number is an Adam Number or not.

# Examples:

# Input:
# 12
# Output:
# Adam Number

# Input:
# 13
# Output:
# Not an Adam Number

# Input:
# 11
# Output:
# Adam Number

# Example:
# 12 → 12² = 144, reverse(12) = 21 → 21² = 441 → reverse of 144

n=int(input("Enter a number: "))

num=n**2
rev=0
while n>0:
    rev=rev*10+n%10
    n=n//10
print(num,rev**2)    

revsqr=rev**2
x=0
while revsqr>0:
    x=x*10+revsqr%10
    revsqr=revsqr//10


if x==num:
    print("AdamNumber")
else:
    print("Not Adam Number")

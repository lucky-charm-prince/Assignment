# 7. Banking Withdrawal Limit System


# A bank wants to set withdrawal limits based on the available account balance:

# * Balance less than ₹1000 → Withdrawal not allowed
# * ₹1000 to ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹1000
# * Above ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹5000

# Write a Python program to display the withdrawal limit.

# Input:
# Enter account balance: 3500

# Output:
# Maximum Withdrawal Limit: ₹1000

balance=int(input("enter the balance="))
if balance<1000:
    print("withdrawal not allowed")
elif balance>=1000 and balance<=5000:
    print("maximum withdrawal limit=1000")
else:
    print("maximum withdrawal limit= 5000")

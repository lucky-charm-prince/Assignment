# 6. Company Bonus Distribution System


# A company wants to calculate bonuses for employees based on their years of experience:

# * More than 10 years → 20% bonus
# * 5 to 10 years → 10% bonus
# * 2 to 5 years → 5% bonus
# * Less than 2 years → No bonus

# Write a Python program to calculate the bonus amount.

# Input:
# Enter salary: 50000
# Enter years of experience: 6

# Output:
# Bonus Amount: ₹5000

salary=int(input("enter the salary="))
experience=int(input("enter the experience"))
if experience>10:
    print("bonus amount=",(salary*20)//100)
elif experience>=5 and experience<=10:
    print("bonus amount=",(salary*10)//100)
elif experience>=2 and experience<=5:
    print("bonus amount=",(salary*5)//100)
else:
    print("no bouns")

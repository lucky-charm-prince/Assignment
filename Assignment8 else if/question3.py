# 3. Income Tax Department System

# The Income Tax Department needs a system to calculate tax payable by citizens based on their annual income:

# * Up to ₹2,50,000 → No tax
# * ₹2,50,001 to ₹5,00,000 → 5% tax
# * ₹5,00,001 to ₹10,00,000 → 20% tax
# * Above ₹10,00,000 → 30% tax

# Write a Python program to calculate the tax amount.

# Input:
# Enter annual income: 800000

# Output:
# Tax Payable: ₹110000
income=int(input("enter the annual income="))
if income<=250000:
    print("no tax")
elif income>=250001 and income<=500000:
    print((income*5)//100)
elif income>=500001 and income<=1000000:
    print((income*20)//100)
else:
    print((income*30)//100)

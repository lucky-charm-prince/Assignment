# 3. Composite Number Detector

# A product testing company labels batch numbers as risky if they have more than two factors. Such numbers are known as composite numbers and indicate repeated grouping patterns.

# The quality control officer enters a batch number, and the software checks whether it is Composite or Not.

# Write a program to check whether a number is Composite or Not.

# Input:
# 12

# Output:
# Composite Number
